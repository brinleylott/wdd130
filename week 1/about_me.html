    <h2>Education and Career Path</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I am currently persuing my associates in Web Design and Development.
        After I achieve my associates I will move onto my bachelors in the same major.
        As for my career path, I hope to become a Web Designer and work with businesses to 
        better their websites. 
    </p>
    <h2>Family :)</h2>
    <p>
        In A few days I will be marying my best friend and starting a little family! 
        We met at BYU-Idaho and I think that has been my favorite part of my college 
        expirience thus far. My fiance and I enjoy exploring nature around Rexburg, 
        trying new recipes, and watching quality television (specifically Psych).
